# REST API with MongoDB
edX Module 4 Assignment Lab: REST API with MongoDB

The assignment lab for this module is to build a REST API using Mongoose.

> In the previous module, you've built a CRUD RESTful with Express and the native MongoDB Node.js driver (mongodb on npm). However, as you saw in Module 4 Mongoose offers a lot of useful features and benefits compared to the native MongoDB driver. Let's use Mongoose as a database library and ODM for a server.

> In this lab, you'll implement a persistent Express REST API server with MongoDB and the Mongoose native driver.
